#Addon description of MessageNotifier.

# Introduction #

When a chat message containing your name showed up in any of the default chat frames, MessageNotifier will pop up a big frame containing the messages. When the message frame is being shown, a notification sound will keep playing every few seconds to get your notice. Press escape or click the close button to hide the frame. The messages in the notification frame will be cleared when you close the frame.

Type "/mn" in the game to toggle this mod on and off.
